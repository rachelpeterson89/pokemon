Coding Dojo API &amp; Ajax Assignment

Assignment: Pokemon
Using the PokeAPI, create a page that shows the first 151 Pokemon sprite images. You can build out 151 images by hand or you can use a for-loop in JavaScript and your jQuery knowledge to produce the image tags in the body of your HTML.  If the images load slowly, consider only loading 15 images. 

    <!-- add http:// before the website name -->

Note: These images are hot-linked and may not work. Utilize the api v2 to find a sprite image that you can use to display the pokemon!
